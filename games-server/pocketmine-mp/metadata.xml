  <longdescription>
    A highly customisable, open source server software for Minecraft: Bedrock Edition written in PHP
    A powerful plugin API, which allows you to extend and customize your server far more easily and 
    extensively than any competing server implementations, including the official vanilla server.
    Multi-world support, allowing you to offer a more varied game experience to players without transferring them to other server nodes.
    Performance fit to hold 100+ players.
    PocketMine-MP has the longest and best track record of any custom server for compatibility with new Minecraft versions.
